%-------------------------------------------
% K nearest neighbour (KNN) classification
% code by Jaakko Peltonen 2008
%-------------------------------------------
% Classifies test points based on majority vote of their k nearest
% neighbours in train points. 'Nearest' is determined from squared 
% Euclidean distance. In case the majority voting results in a tie,
% gives equal portions to each class in the tie.
%
% Inputs:
%---------
% train_points: matrix, the i:th row has the features of the i:th 
%               training point.
%
% train_labels: two possible formats. 
%   Format 1: a column vector where the i:th element is an integer 
%             value indicating the label of the i:th training
%             point. The labels should start from zero.
%
%   Format 2: a matrix where the i:th row has the class memberships
%             of the i:th training point. Each class membership is
%             a value from 0 to 1, where 1 means the point fully 
%             belongs to that class.
%
% test_points: feature matrix for test points. Same format as
%    train_points. You can give an empty matrix: then the method
%    computes leave-one-out classification error based only on
%    the training points.
%
% Outputs:
%---------
% classifications: matrix, the i:th row has the predicted class
%             memberships of the i:th test point. Each class
%             membership if a value from 0 to 1, where 1 means
%             the test point is predicted to fully belong to
%             that class.
